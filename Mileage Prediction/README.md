# Mileage Prediction Dataset
## Prerequisites:
Before running the code associated with the dataset, ensure you have the following:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. Necessary libraries installed, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization.
3. Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment of your choice for running the code.

## Steps to Run the Code:

1. Download the dataset file containing the information on mpg, cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model_year, origin, and name.
2. Make sure the dataset file is in the same directory as your code or provide the correct path to the file in your code.
3. Open your Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, PyCharm).
4. Load the dataset into your Python environment using a library like Pandas.
5. Preprocess the data if necessary (e.g., handle missing values, encode categorical variables).
6. Implement your machine learning model to predict the mileage ('mpg') based on other features.
7. Train your model on a portion of the dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error or R-squared.
8. Optionally, fine-tune your model parameters or try different algorithms for better performance.
9. Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new data or further analyze the dataset as needed.

## About the Dataset:

The dataset contains information related to vehicles and their characteristics. Here's a brief overview of the features included: https://github.com/Venkatesan2k/DataScience/blob/main/Mileage%20Prediction/Car%20Dataset.csv
 
- mpg: Miles per gallon, representing the fuel efficiency of the vehicle.
- cylinders: The number of cylinders in the vehicle's engine.
- displacement: The engine displacement, typically measured in cubic inches or cubic centimeters.
- horsepower: The power of the vehicle's engine, usually measured in horsepower.
- weight: The weight of the vehicle, often measured in pounds or kilograms.
- acceleration: The acceleration performance of the vehicle, usually measured in seconds from 0 to 60 mph or 0 to 100 km/h.
- model_year: The year of manufacture of the vehicle.
- origin: The origin of the vehicle, which may represent the country of manufacture or assembly.
- name: The name or identifier of the vehicle.

This dataset can be used for various purposes, including exploratory data analysis, machine learning model development for predicting vehicle mileage, and studying the relationship between different vehicle features and fuel efficiency.
