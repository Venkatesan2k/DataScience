# Iris Prediction
## Description:
The Iris dataset is a classic and widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of various features of Iris flowers, along with their species. The dataset is often used for classification, clustering, and data visualization tasks.

## Dataset:
1. Dataset from https://github.com/Venkatesan2k/DataScience/blob/main/Iris%20Prediction/Iris.csv 
2. You can import from sklearn
      - from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
      - iris = load_iris()
## Content:
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

1. Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal (the green leaf-like structures) in centimeters.
2. Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal in centimeters.
3. Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal (the colorful flower part) in centimeters.
4. Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal in centimeters.
- Species: The species of Iris flowers, which include Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Purpose:
The Iris dataset is commonly used for the following purposes:

- Classification: Predicting the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.
- Clustering: Grouping similar Iris flowers based on their feature measurements.
- Data Visualization: Visualizing the relationships between different features and species of Iris flowers.
- Prediction: Predict the species of the entering data
