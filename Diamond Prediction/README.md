# Diamond Prediction Dataset

## Description:
The Diamond Prediction dataset contains information about various attributes of diamonds, such as carat weight, cut, color, clarity, and price. The dataset is commonly used for regression and classification tasks in machine learning, particularly for predicting the price of diamonds based on their characteristics.

## Content:
The dataset typically includes the following attributes:

1. Carat Weight: The weight of the diamond, measured in carats.
2. Cut Quality: The quality of the diamond's cut, which can be categorized as Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, or Ideal.
3. Color: The color grade of the diamond, typically ranging from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown).
4. Clarity: The clarity grade of the diamond, indicating the presence of internal flaws or inclusions, ranging from Flawless (IF) to Included (I3).
5. Depth: The depth of the diamond, expressed as a percentage of its overall diameter.
6. Table: The width of the diamond's table (the flat surface on the top), expressed as a percentage of its overall diameter.
7. Price: The price of the diamond, which serves as the target
